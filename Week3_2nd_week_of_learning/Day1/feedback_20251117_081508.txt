suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments within the methods to explain the logic more clearly.
- Could refactor the `dog_sizes` function to use `max` with a key for better readability, but this is a minor point.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the exercises as described in the chapter content, including creating classes and objects, defining methods, using attributes, and applying conditional statements. The Zoo exercise also includes the bonus request, making the solution complete.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The comments are helpful, and the variable names are descriptive. There are some minor opportunities to improve readability with more comments inside the methods.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the given exercises. The algorithms used are appropriate for the scale of the problems.
- security: The code doesn't involve any user input or external data, so there are no security concerns.
