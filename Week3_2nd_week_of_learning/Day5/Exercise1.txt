Answer the following questions:

- What is a class? This is a template or pattern for creating objects. It defines the common attributes (data) 
and methods (behavior) that all objects of this class will share. Each object created from the class can have its own 
attribute values ​​and even behave slightly differently.
- What is an instance? This is a specific object created based on a class. If a class is a template, then an instance 
is a real object with its own attributes and behavior described in the class.
- What is encapsulation? This is an OOP principle that defines the data and implementation details of a project.
Other parts of the program can use an object only through its public methods, without directly affecting its internal attributes.
- What is abstraction? This is an OOP principle that allows you to focus only on what is important and necessary for using an object, 
hiding all unnecessary implementation details.
= What is inheritance? It is an OOP principle that allows one class to obtain the properties and behavior of another class.
- What is multiple inheritance? This is when one class inherits properties and methods from several classes at once.
- What is polymorphism? This is when you can call the same method on different classes, and each class will perform its own specific action.
- What is method resolution order or MRO? This is the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes when inheriting.
