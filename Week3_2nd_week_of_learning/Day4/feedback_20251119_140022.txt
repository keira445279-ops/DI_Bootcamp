suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a `try-except` block around the file opening in `get_words_from_file` to handle potential `FileNotFoundError`.
- For better readability in `main()`, you can store the input prompt message in a variable.
- In Exercise 2, you might want to add an `indent` parameter to `json.dump()` for better formatting of the saved JSON file.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both Exercise 1 and Exercise 2, following all instructions and fulfilling the specified goals. It correctly handles file reading, random sentence generation, JSON parsing, key access, modification, and saving, as described in the chapter content. All steps are implemented as intended.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand, with helpful comments explaining each step. However, minor improvements, such as storing the input prompt in a variable, could enhance readability further.
- performance: The code exhibits good performance for the given tasks. The file reading and JSON operations are efficient. There are no significant performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code doesn't have any major security vulnerabilities. Using `with open(...)` ensures proper file handling and prevents resource leaks. The input validation in Exercise 1 helps to prevent unexpected errors.
