    "## 1) What is Machine Learning and why it matters for data analysts\n",
    "- Machine Learning is a set of methods where a computer learns to make predictions or find patterns in data without being explicitly programmed with every rule.\n",
    "- It matters for data analysts because it:\n",
    "  - helps automate predictions (sales, customer churn, etc.),\n",
    "  - finds hidden patterns in large datasets,\n",
    "  - improves decision-making based on data — faster and often more accurate than manual analysis,\n",
    "  - expands capabilities: clustering, segmentation, recommendations, anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Applications of ML across industries (examples)\n",
    "- Retail / e-commerce:\n",
    "  - recommendation systems (what to show a customer),\n",
    "  - demand forecasting.\n",
    "- Banking & finance:\n",
    "  - fraud detection in transactions,\n",
    "  - credit scoring.\n",
    "- Healthcare:\n",
    "  - aiding diagnosis from images (e.g., X-rays),\n",
    "  - predicting patient complications.\n",
    "- Manufacturing:\n",
    "  - predictive maintenance (when to replace a part),\n",
    "  - production-line optimization.\n",
    "- Marketing:\n",
    "  - customer segmentation and personalized campaigns,\n",
    "  - predicting ad campaign response.\n",

    "## 3) Differences: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning\n",
    "  - Definition: the model learns from data that includes inputs and known correct answers (labels).\n",
    "  - When to use: when you have historical data with a target variable.\n",
    "  - Example scenario: predict whether a loan will be approved (label: yes/no), predict house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning\n",
    "  - Definition: the model finds structure or groups in data without known answers.\n",
    "  - When to use: when there are no labels but you want to understand data structure.\n",
    "  - Example scenario: segment customers by behavior (clustering), detect anomalies in logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning\n",
    "  - Definition: an agent learns to take sequential actions in an environment, receiving rewards or penalties; the goal is to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
    "  - When to use: when you need to optimize a sequence of actions in a dynamic environment.\n",
    "  - Example scenario: controlling a warehouse robot, real-time price optimization, learning a game strategy."
