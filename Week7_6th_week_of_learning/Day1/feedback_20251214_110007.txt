suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each query.
- The explanation after the failed insertion attempt could be made more concise.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code directly addresses the questions in the 'Instructions' section. It counts the number of actors and attempts to add a new actor with a blank field, demonstrating understanding of SQL constraints. The code is correct and relevant to the chapter content.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear SQL statements. Using comments to delineate each part would improve readability.
- performance: The SQL queries are simple and efficient for the given task. No performance concerns.
- security: The code uses parameterized queries implicitly which prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.
