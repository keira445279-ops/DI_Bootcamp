suggestions for improvement:
- Consider removing commented-out code for better readability in the final version.
- The comments are helpful, but consider a more consistent style (e.g., using consistent capitalization or spacing).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately creates the 'items' and 'customers' tables, inserts the specified data, and performs all the required queries, aligning perfectly with the instructions in Exercise 1.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear table and column names. The use of comments enhances understanding. However, the commented-out code slightly reduces readability.
- performance: The SQL queries are straightforward and efficient for the given task. Indexing could be considered for larger datasets, but it's not necessary here.
- security: The code uses standard SQL syntax and doesn't involve any user input, so there are no immediate security concerns. Prepared statements and parameterized queries could be employed in a real application where user input is involved.
