Brief justification:
- correctness: The code directly addresses all the instructions in the problem description. It takes user input, checks the length, prints the first and last characters, builds the string character by character, and jumbles the string as a bonus. This aligns perfectly with the chapter content.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain each step, and the variable names are descriptive.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs the required tasks without any unnecessary overhead.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. The input is used in a safe manner without any risk of injection or other attacks.
