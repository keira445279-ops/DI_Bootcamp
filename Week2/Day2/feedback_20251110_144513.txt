Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 generates a list of multiples, and Challenge 2 removes consecutive duplicate letters from a string. The code produces the expected outputs for the given examples.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of comments to outline each challenge and explain the steps enhances readability.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods to solve both challenges. For Challenge 1, a simple loop is used to generate the multiples. For Challenge 2, iterating through the string once is sufficient to remove consecutive duplicates.
- security: The code uses the `input()` function to get input from the user, but it converts the input to integers and string, mitigating potential security risks.
