suggestions for improvement:
- Add input validation in `get_user_item` to ensure the user enters a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
- Consider using a dictionary or a set to store the valid user choices for easier validation.
- The `__init__` method is currently empty. While not strictly required, consider initializing any game-related state here.
